14E071000 , Takata Corporation (Takata) has determined that certain SDI-X air bag inflators, manufactured June 16, 2008, to June 20, 2014, may have been manufactured with an incorrect outer baffle.   In the event of a crash necessitating deployment of the driver's frontal air bag, the incorrect baffle may block the flow of the propellant to the air bag and the air bag's inflator may rupture.  The rupture could cause metal fragments to strike and potentially seriously injure the vehicle occupants. Takata will be working with vehicle manufacturers to determine into which vehicles the affected inflators were installed either as original equipment, replacement equipment, or as a recall remedy part.  As this work progresses, numerous vehicle recalls will likely be announced by the impacted vehicle manufacturers.  NHTSA will supply this information as soon as possible.
